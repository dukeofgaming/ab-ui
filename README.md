# AB UI Design System

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Features

## Requirements

1. Configurable Design System
- Accommodate multiple color palettes for logical application grouping.
- Allow theming or restyling without altering core component logic.
2. Version-Controlled Components
- Maintain a single source of truth for design assets (Figma, Sketch, etc.) mapped to frontend component
versions.
- Provide clear lineage between design revisions, code commits, and semantic releases.
3. Version-Controlled Application Blueprints
- Keep application designs fully tracked and linked to corresponding codebase updates.
- Tie feature branches and releases directly to specific design documents.
4. Independent Library Versioning
- Use a mechanism (e.g., semantic versioning) to facilitate controlled, incremental upgrades of shared
components.
- Allow multiple component library versions to coexist without breaking existing applications.
5. Repository Strategy
- Minimize the total number of repos while avoiding a monolithic structure.
- Consider a monorepo for shared libraries and micro-repos/packages for individual apps.
6. Collaboration and Contributions
- Streamline contributions from a large developer community through local dev setups, peer-review
workflows, and automated checks.
- Prevent design drift by enforcing consistency between component implementation and design
specifications.
7. Release Notes and Documentation
- Automatically generate release notes, highlighting changes, deprecations, and upgrade paths.
- Keep documentation synchronized with each component and its version.
8. Large-Scale Application Management
- Provide a simple mechanism for teams to independently maintain, upgrade, or retire applications.
- Preserve consistent UX and unified design standards across all apps.

Tangible workflows, tools, and architectural decisions that pave the way for a resilient, future-proof frontend environment.


## Migration Strategy


1. Preserving Business Continuity: Keep existing operations stable throughout each migration phase.
2. Consistent Releases: Show regular progress to instill confidence in both end users and the engineering
organization.
Propose any methods, technologies, or processes you believe will facilitate a smooth, disruption-free transition.
