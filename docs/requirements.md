# Requirements

This document is a living document that will be updated as the requirements evolve.

References to architectural decisions and stories will be denoted with double square brackets, e.g. [[ADR-0]] and [[Feature-0]].

## Context

Our company’s frontend ecosystem has become increasingly fragmented over time, with on-device apps, multi-language web apps, and static sites spread across more than 300 repositories developed over decades. Many of these interfaces lack formal design standards, automated testing (unit, integration, E2E; see [[Feature-1]]), and telemetry.
Documentation is limited due to staff turnover (see [[ADR-0]], [[ADR-3]]), and production deployments can take days or even weeks.

Despite these challenges, our frontend platforms deliver mission-critical functionality to diverse audiences—
internal teams, customers, and suppliers. These systems handle:

- Financial workflows (budgeting, forecasting)
- Ordering and shipment management
- Logistics planning, simulation, and execution
- Product pricing simulation, planning, and approval workflows
- Master data maintenance (products, customers, suppliers, accounting)
- Sales, logistics, financial, and marketing performance communications
- Payment processing and notifications between customers and suppliers
- Promotional information to various user groups
- Algorithmically generated task recommendations

The Frontend Guild’s objective is to consolidate this fractured environment into a unified, modern architecture—
resembling platforms like google.com or office.com—while offering the robust capabilities of Amazon, QuickBooks,
and contemporary banking solutions. The vision is to adopt a shared design system that supports independent
releases, upgrades, and deprecations, all without disrupting critical services. By implementing a cohesive,
maintainable architecture, we aim to foster rapid innovation, enable fast and reliable deployments, and create a
seamless, satisfying user experience.

## Part 1
Your challenge is to build a working prototype that aligns with our new company-wide design system, target-state
architecture, and overarching vision. It must address the following engineering requirements:

### 1. **Configurable Design System**

#### 1.1
Accommodate multiple color palettes for logical application grouping.

#### 1.2
Allow theming or restyling without altering core component logic (see [[ADR-1]], [[ADR-2]]).

### 2. **Version-Controlled Components**

#### 2.1
Maintain a single source of truth for design assets (Figma, Sketch, etc.) mapped to frontend component versions (see [[ADR-2]]).

#### 2.2
Provide clear lineage between design revisions, code commits, and semantic releases.

### 3. **Version-Controlled Application Blueprints**

#### 3.1
Keep application designs fully tracked and linked to corresponding codebase updates.

#### 3.2
Tie feature branches and releases directly to specific design documents (see [[ADR-3]]).

### 4. **Independent Library Versioning**

#### 4.1
Use a mechanism (e.g., semantic versioning) to facilitate controlled, incremental upgrades of shared components (see [[ADR-1]],[[ADR-2]]).

#### 4.2
Allow multiple component library versions to coexist without breaking existing applications (see [[ADR-1#Consequences]]).

### 5. **Repository Strategy**

#### 5.1
Minimize the total number of repos while avoiding a monolithic structure.

#### 5.2
Consider a monorepo for shared libraries and micro-repos/packages for individual apps.

### 6. **Collaboration and Contributions**
#### 6.1
Streamline contributions from a large developer community through local dev setups (see [[Feature-0]]), peer-review workflows, and automated checks.

#### 6.2
Prevent design drift by enforcing consistency between component implementation and design specifications (see [[ADR-2]]).

### 7. **Release Notes and Documentation**
#### 7.1
Automatically generate release notes, highlighting changes, deprecations, and upgrade paths.

#### 7.2
Keep documentation synchronized with each component and its version (see [[ADR-3]], [[Feature-0]])

### 8. **Large-Scale Application Management**
#### 8.1
Provide a simple mechanism for teams to independently maintain, upgrade, or retire applications.

#### 8.2
Preserve consistent UX and unified design standards across all apps.

Your prototype should demonstrate tangible workflows, tools, and architectural decisions (see [[ADR-0]]) that pave the way for a resilient, future-proof frontend environment.

## Part 2
Building on your prototype and our current fragmented setup, please compose a succinct strategy (no more than
400 words) for transitioning from the legacy state to the new, unified architecture (see [[legacy-transition]]). The plan should address:

1. **Preserving Business Continuity:** Keep existing operations stable throughout each migration phase.

2. **Consistent Releases:** Show regular progress to instill confidence in both end users and the engineering organization.

Propose any methods, technologies, or processes you believe will facilitate a smooth, disruption-free transition.
