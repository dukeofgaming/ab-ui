# Context

Our company’s frontend ecosystem has become increasingly fragmented over time, with on-device apps, multi-language web apps, and static sites spread across more than 300 repositories developed over decades. Many of these interfaces lack formal design standards, automated testing (unit, integration, E2E), and telemetry.
Documentation is limited due to staff turnover, and production deployments can take days or even weeks.

Despite these challenges, our frontend platforms deliver mission-critical functionality to diverse audiences—
internal teams, customers, and suppliers. These systems handle:
- Financial workflows (budgeting, forecasting)
- Ordering and shipment management
- Logistics planning, simulation, and execution
- Product pricing simulation, planning, and approval workflows
- Master data maintenance (products, customers, suppliers, accounting)
- Sales, logistics, financial, and marketing performance communications
- Payment processing and notifications between customers and suppliers
- Promotional information to various user groups
- Algorithmically generated task recommendations

The Frontend Guild’s objective is to consolidate this fractured environment into a unified, modern architecture—
resembling platforms like google.com or office.com—while offering the robust capabilities of Amazon, QuickBooks,
and contemporary banking solutions. The vision is to adopt a shared design system that supports independent
releases, upgrades, and deprecations, all without disrupting critical services. By implementing a cohesive,
maintainable architecture, we aim to foster rapid innovation, enable fast and reliable deployments, and create a
seamless, satisfying user experience.

# Part 1
Your challenge is to build a working prototype that aligns with our new company-wide design system, target-state
architecture, and overarching vision. It must address the following engineering requirements:

1. **Configurable Design System**

- Accommodate multiple color palettes for logical application grouping.
- Allow theming or restyling without altering core component logic.

2. **Version-Controlled Components**

- Maintain a single source of truth for design assets (Figma, Sketch, etc.) mapped to frontend component
versions.
- Provide clear lineage between design revisions, code commits, and semantic releases.

3. **Version-Controlled Application Blueprints**

- Keep application designs fully tracked and linked to corresponding codebase updates.
- Tie feature branches and releases directly to specific design documents.

4. **Independent Library Versioning**

- Use a mechanism (e.g., semantic versioning) to facilitate controlled, incremental upgrades of shared
components.
- Allow multiple component library versions to coexist without breaking existing applications.

5. **Repository Strategy**

- Minimize the total number of repos while avoiding a monolithic structure.
- Consider a monorepo for shared libraries and micro-repos/packages for individual apps.

6. **Collaboration and Contributions**

- Streamline contributions from a large developer community through local dev setups, peer-review
workflows, and automated checks.
- Prevent design drift by enforcing consistency between component implementation and design
specifications.

7. **Release Notes and Documentation**

- Automatically generate release notes, highlighting changes, deprecations, and upgrade paths.
- Keep documentation synchronized with each component and its version.

8. **Large-Scale Application Management**

- Provide a simple mechanism for teams to independently maintain, upgrade, or retire applications.
- Preserve consistent UX and unified design standards across all apps.

Your prototype should demonstrate tangible workflows, tools, and architectural decisions that pave the way for a
resilient, future-proof frontend environment.

# Part 2
Building on your prototype and our current fragmented setup, please compose a succinct strategy (no more than
400 words) for transitioning from the legacy state to the new, unified architecture. The plan should address:

1. **Preserving Business Continuity:** Keep existing operations stable throughout each migration phase.

2. **Consistent Releases:** Show regular progress to instill confidence in both end users and the engineering organization.

Propose any methods, technologies, or processes you believe will facilitate a smooth, disruption-free transition.
