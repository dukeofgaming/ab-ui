# ADR 3: Low Overhead Live Documentation

## Context

Throughout the [[requirements]] document, there is a recurring need for documentation that is aligned with the codebase, in addition to component documentation.

## Decision

Adopt [Docs as Code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/) as a methodology to enable low overhead live documentation for developers and a developer audience.

## Consequences

1. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) will be used as the primary tools for documentation outside the use of Storybook.
