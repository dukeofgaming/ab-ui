# Feature #6: Streamline collaboration and contributions

<!-- General requirement in user story form, e.g.: As a persona, I need a feature, so that I can accomplish something -->

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Consider a monorepo for shared libraries and micro-repos/packages for individual apps (see [[requirements#5.2]])


- [ ] Streamline contributions from a large developer community through local dev setups, peer-review workflows, and automated checks (see [[requirements#6.1]])

    - [ ] Publish DevContainer image to GitHub Container Registry for quicker local setup with VSCode as a baseline experience

    - [ ] Create promotion PR mechanism

- [ ] Minimize the total number of repos while avoiding a monolithic structure (see [[requirements#5.1]])
